# Tissue Biomechanics Lab Template

The latex template is in the doc folder along with a basic Makefile.
The template has some <++> characters which are placeholders that need to be replaced. (This is what the vim-latex-suite uses).

On macOS I am using [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) which can be installed using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```
brew cask install mactex
```
